**Autocomplete Feature Implementation in NLP**

This project is focused on implementing an autocomplete feature using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to create a system that predicts the next word or sequence of words based on the input provided by the user. The project walks through the steps of data preprocessing, model implementation, training, testing, and evaluation to develop a robust autocomplete functionality.

**Project Overview**

This project is designed as an assignment to explore the concepts of autocomplete in the context of NLP. The task is to predict the next possible words in a sentence or phrase based on historical data and language models.

**Key Objectives**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the text data to be used for model training.
- **Model Implementation:** Implement an autocomplete system using various NLP techniques and models.
- **Training:** Train the model on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and predict subsequent words.
- **Evaluation:** Test the autocomplete feature and analyze its performance based on different metrics.
- **Custom Predictions:** Allow users to input their own text and see the autocomplete suggestions generated by the model.

**Notebook Structure**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and tokenize the text data.
   - Prepare sequences of words to be used as input for the model.

2. **Model Implementation:**
   - Implement the language model for predicting the next word(s) based on input sequences.

3. **Training:**
   - Train the model on the prepared text sequences to learn the contextual patterns.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Test the model's ability to predict the next word and evaluate its accuracy.

5. **Custom Predictions:**
   - Users can input their text to see the autocomplete suggestions provided by the model.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x: The programming language used for this project.
- Jupyter Notebook: To run the .ipynb file.

**Installation**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MatasT-uni/NLP-Language-Models-Auto-Complete
   cd NLP-Language-Models-Auto-Complete
   ```
2. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas nltk tensorflow
   ```
3. **Run the Notebook:**
   Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to see the implementation of the autocomplete feature.

**Usage**
- Run the notebook to see the step-by-step implementation of the autocomplete feature.
- Use the trained model to predict and suggest the next word(s) based on the provided input.
- Analyze the model's performance and explore areas for improvement.

**Results**
This project demonstrates the process of building an autocomplete feature using NLP. Through this process, the model's accuracy and efficiency in predicting next words can be evaluated, providing insights into model behavior and areas for potential enhancement.
